These notes are a second attempt at a [[Digital Garden]] and as such are a little wild and untamed. There's no central index or table of contents; you explore by going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole.

> I'm just a person trying to figure things out; thinking and learning [with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). As such the thoughts here should be viewed as incomplete, inelegant and extremely malleable.  Take a look at all of the things I am curious about [[What am I Curious About|here]].

Things I will do here include:
- Not use correct sentence structure
- use ﬆrange ligatures like æ instead of *ae* for no reason other than liking how it looks

### That being said, here are some good pages to start at:
All the bits of my #writing on their way to becoming [[Evergreen Notes]]
- [[for grandma]] - *Written for and read at my grandmother's funeral. The first time I shared my writing publicly and probably my favorite thing I've written*
- [[Grieving together]]
- My [[failure résumé]]

### __What am I working on right__ [[NOW]]?


You can peruse some of my #favorite stuff here
  - [[How to Be the Greatest Improviser on Earth#^971708|know, care, say]]

Still confused? Read the unfinished piece about the design methodology behind my writing
