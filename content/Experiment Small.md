Recently I've been trying to pare down my projects into more manageable bites and [[experiment]] small. I have a habit of getting a big idea, attacking it with lots of initial enthusiasm, and then abandoning it once the drive wears off. By creating full but tiny projects and quickly getting to a 'success' I prevent burn out (see [[using experimentation as a way of life]]).

This feels like an extension of 'chunking' tasks but for creative projects or maybe even [[Article/Successful habits through smoothly ratcheting targets]]
- > chunking is the act of taking a large problem and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable problems/tasks.

The corkscrew method [^1]
- What feels like closed loops up close is actually a spiral upwards
- `{{[[drawing]]}}`

Already I cycle projects and interests roughly in seasons. This emerges naturally, bottom up instead of top down 
- Code projects mostly happen in the early summer 
- hardware projects happen midwinter

This has been especially useful while learning to code. Do little projects, learning something specific each time, and before you know it you have a toolbox full of useful skills.
Also keeps the [[ADD]] boredom at bay

### Examples of small experments
- Custom [[AI]] holiday wrapping paper
- [[cataloging the mundane]]
- pretty much all of my [[RoamDepot]] extensions
- Ben's CCMLS tracker app
- Jogging around the block
