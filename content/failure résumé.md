 Failures big and small. Professional and personal :)

I read today about the idea of the [[failure résumé]], something I instantly resonated with. I've been fascinated by #failure for years. I've often found that people present a tidy narrative of their accomplishments to the world. In general people are __really bad__ at talking about their own failures without putting a spin on it. Social media exacerbates this, showing only the highlights of a person's life. 

What I find much more interesting is all of the things that they tried that either didn't work for them or didn't work out. ie what did they do that failed?[^1][^2]


So what could I put on my [[failure résumé]]?

I remember talking to [[Person/Pelin Akman]] about improv and how I didn't fully realize it at the time but I was actually teaching myself how to fail

At this point I've failed at more things than most people have started. It's a part of being [curious]([[curiosity]])!

# Résumé

???
2023
was unable to finish my first real coding commission for [[App/Obsidian.md]]
<<<
this is in part due to extenuating circumstances (ie my grandmother passed away suddenly) but also due to not understanding my own limitations? it also just wasn't very fun to work with. I'd been off more than I could chew and don't really love arbitrary deadlines. oh and work got insane randomly at the same time. truly a bad couple weeks.<br>I took the commission for the money. Not because I actually wanted or enjoyed the thing which meant I had little to no stake in the outcome

2022
Missed or didn't understand the door width designations for glass doors at #work . The sub had gone rogue and changed all the doors putting nearly every single glass door on the project out of ADA compliance.
!!!

???
2021
Was rejected for a position at [[Roam Research]]
<<<
Ended up being for the best as I ended up freelancing part time there which is 100% better all around.
!!!

???
2019
Bombed while doing #improv a **lot**. Easily over 100 times
!!!

???
2011
Didn't get into my college jazz band at a school definitely not known for music. Dissolution, some boring medical stuff, and lack of easy practice spots evolved into me never playing again
<<<
I think the social aspect of the music was the largest motivator and when that went away I was less inclined to play

[^2]: There's an interesting podcast called Podcast/How to Fail semi-related to this (though it ends up being kind of tidy-narrative based).
