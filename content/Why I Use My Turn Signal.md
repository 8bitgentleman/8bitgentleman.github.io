 The rules are there for a specific purpose, in this case to keep you safe. If you are safe than the specifics of the rule is unnecessary.

 The larger role self-dicipline plays in everyday life.

 This is not an attempt at belilttling or looking down on 'other' people. Adherence to this does not make a person weak willed or lesser. I liken this to the rigid military tradition of making a bed each morning.

 dicipline in small things vastly aids dicpline in large things

 Does this mean I'm an insufferable rule fanatic? Someone who correctly grammer durring conversation? Not at all, or at least I try not to be.
