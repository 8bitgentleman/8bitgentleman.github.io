The internet is becoming more homogenized.
I spend quite a bit of time on the cozy web. I love it's quirks and strange design choices. It's emphasize on design and typography .[^1]

It feels odd to call these places websites. They're kind of blogs but not formalized Wordpress lookalikes; kind of journals but more public; kind of personal wiki but more experimental. These spaces are far and few between.

Tools like the Readwise Reader and Pocket are designed to scrape away the top layer of advertisement and distraction and general JS crud to produce a clean, indexable, and clearly readable page. The page's purest form.[^2]

This is immensely useful but comes at the cost of homogenization. Sure the popups and ads are gone but so are the dropcaps and weird fleuron. Interesting font choices and __style__. Unique design sacrificed for readability.[^3]

For news sites, blogs and websites it's often a welcome addition but for the cozy web it's a death blow.

[^3]: there's something about the flattening of the web that makes reading a little boring? Perhaps [[sameness and difference]] is related
