## What is a **NOW** page?

The **NOW** page is an interesting addition to a #[[Digital Garden]] which differs from an **ABOUT** page in a few key ways

1.  **ABOUT** pages are typically polished narratives describing a person (trends in years to decades)

2.  **NOW** pages are ephemeral and constantly changing places describing the person you are in the short term (weeks to months)

3.  **NOW** pages contain less professional and more personal interests than **ABOUT** pages


### What are some good examples of a **NOW** page?

## NOW

### Fall 2023


- Trying to limit code projects and of course ended up creating this digital garden lol

- Spending lots of time scootering (scooting? what's the most fun term in this scenario?) around [[NYC]] and exploring some of the more difficult to get to spots. This is the first cold weather I've experienced since January??

- Feeling a general mentality shift that I haven't been able to define yet but is full of restlessness. I thought it was boredom at first, maybe distraction, but I think more likely it was the changing of my (internal) season


### Summer 2023


- Focused in on work and code projects.

- Laid low and experimented with different ways of bringing natural textures into my apartment design through art. It's weird to have a second summer in a single year .


### Sprint 2023


- Fucked off to [[New Zealand Trip|New Zealand]] for ~2 months work & travel. I didn't realize it at the time but it was very much a reaction to the terrible-work-projectâ„¢ of 2022
