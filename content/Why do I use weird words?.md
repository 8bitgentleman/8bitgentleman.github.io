 I use 'weird' words. Weird turns of phrase too but mainly weird words. By weird, of course, I mean uncommon or in a different context than you'd expect. Also [[Weird doesn't exist]]. This isn't out of some weird intellectual superiority complex, or a desire to raise my own status, and I  CERTAINLY do **not** look down on anyone who doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about. 

 I do this for several reasons

1.  I like words. Unique ones, ones that are fun to say, overly specific ones, you name it.


    - I've been collecting words and phrases that I like for almost a decade at this point of which the full list can be found with all my other [[new word]]s. I'm pretty shrewd with what I add there, I have to either enjoy the word or enjoy saying it. 


2.  I dislike personal patterns, especially when it comes to conversation and speech. If I've said something before I'm probably going to try and find a different, more interesting (for me at least) way to say it again. This is an example of the [[joke machine]] mentality I grew up with and thrive in.

3.  I get a thrill when I can cleverly use a word, or convey an idea in a new and precise way.

4.  I read (and have read) a LOT in many different styles, eras, and genres.

5.  I spend time in many vastly different social circles; ones that each have very specific lingo and ways of communicating.  Blending these speech patterns can result in fun new turns of phrase (see # 2).


    - How a designer communicates and talks if very different from how a [[Company/Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]] alum communicates which is also different from how an [[improv|improviser]] communicates.



 ***Points I want to make***


- have run into an odd anti-intellectualism and anger when I use weird words

    - __'”Write like you talk” is good advice, but it’s limiting if you follow it too closely.<br><br>Here’s what I recommend instead:<br><br>1) Maximize both word clarity and word diversity.<br><br>2) Add freshness to your writing by pulling from the “words people know but don’t say” bucket.'__
