 Evergreen note taking is a style of note taking associated with networked though. Evergreen notes, like an evergreen tree, are 'designed' to accumulate usefulness over time

 [[Person/Andy Matuschak]] posits that evergreen notes have 4 properties

1.  [Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF)

2.  [Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC)

3.  [Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z29hLZHiVt7W2uss2uMpSZquAX5T6vaeSF6Cy)

4.  [Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1)


 For me [[Evergreen Notes]] evolve from a loose 4 stage process

1.  #seedlings


    - the brain dump stage


2.  #budding


    - sense is being made out of the brain dump and a structure is emerging


3.  #evergreen


    - well on its way to being a true [[Evergreen Notes|Evergreen Note]] and at a stage where it could be understood by the outside world


4.  #acorn


    - blank placeholder pages with no information that may one day grow into an evergreen or maybe never sprout



 It seems to me that for a note to get to an #evergreen it needs to be a bit of a [volunteer tomato](*"In a garden, you pull everything up. Sometimes a stray vine just keeps coming back. It volunteers. That's really why you, Quentin, you just keep coming."*). A note that just keeps coming back to you, it sticks in your brain almost as if it's volunteering.
