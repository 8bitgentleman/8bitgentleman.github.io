Part of architecture school was learning that creativity is constrained by the tools you have. If you want to make something new oftentimes you have to build new tools as well. You can only build big if you dream big. __"Itâ€™s important to elevate the things and places we use every day ... why not use beautiful things?"__ 

Inspired by this [site](https://willbuildlater.com/) I've put together a living list of things I've always wanted to build. When motivation strikes it can be tricky to know what is worthwhile to build; the first thing you think of is not always the 'best' thing. Conversely ideas have a shelf-life. Sometimes they're pointers to a need that no longer exists or a person you no longer are.

## An incomplete list of things I want to build
### Code
- A better cross platform habit tracker app based on the concept of [[Article/Successful Habits Through Smoothly Ratcheting Targets|smooth ratcheting]]
- A better NYC social calendar
    - most bars and little venues don't publish their calendars anywhere beyond their own plan html websites
### Art
- A webcomic about the apocalypse using only perfectly looped gifs instead of static comic layouts
- 2D animated short film
- NYC isometric pixel art
### Physical
- An [[e-ink]] display with a nice case that connects to Readwise, [[Roam Research]], and Twitter favorites
- Unknown French oak wood project
    - On a whim I bought a piece of French oak with beautiful cathedral-ing. One day I'll find a project for it
### 3D Printed [[uses#^Z0xmwnBMZ]]
- A 3d printed centipede esque LED ring holder
- Quick tests for the e-ink display
