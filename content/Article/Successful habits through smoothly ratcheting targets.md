## quotes:
- __When it’s time to ratchet up the target, adding one day per week to a habit can feel like a huge change! I find that fine-grained values work better when possible. For my piano practice, I don’t use “numbers of days practiced per week”: I use “number of minutes practiced per week.” I barely notice adding ten minutes per week to the goal, so I can smoothly ratchet up my target. ... These fine-grained values also offer more flexibility. ... the flexibility helps me maintain specific goals in the face of my shifting daily interest and availability.__

- __I’ve found that smooth pressure demands we ensure that every day is doable. There should never be an “impossible” day ... We can make that happen if we use moving weekly windows instead of calendar weeks. Every day, look back a week and make sure you hit your goal within that 7-day window__
