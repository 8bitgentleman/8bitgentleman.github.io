# Be Funny
- __"you should play with a sense of joy. We use the word “play” in improv deliberately. While committing and being invested and respecting the emotional truth, you should play with a sense of fun, or even mischief."__
- Chapter:: Be Funny
- __Being funny is a state of mind, and the main ingredient for that state is a hunger to surprise: to give the answer we didn’t think of; to react with an emotion we didn’t expect; to care more than we predicted; to be more specific than necessary.__

# Reps
__It’s normal. Your chords aren’t wrong, you’re just looking at the frets and taking a long time to get your fingers into place. You’re heading down the court in the right direction, but you’re looking at the ball while you dribble. The music starts, but you don’t start dancing for several measures, and when you do you’re behind the beat.__

# Compliment/Boast
__It reminded me that the other actors didn’t see me as someone who wasn’t up to the task, but instead as someone who was being brave and going for it. We were all rooting for each other and focusing on what was working.__
