There's a hugely freeing feeling when you start to allow yourself to be __bad__ at something. When mediocrity isn't just a side-effect but an accepted essential part of what you're doing. Seeking perfection tends to stifled any chance at Finding the Fun inherent in wherever you are. A sense of playfulness can not exist when we seek perfection.

When you know what #discomfort at imperfection feels like you can acknowledge it without letting it control you.  
If whatever you're doing is just play then it's possible to lose whatever game you're in and that's OK. People lose games all the time and it's not a big deal.
Play is usually something reserved when talking about children but when we reframe our own activities under that lens we allow ourselves to let in those moments of embodied joy.


Play implies a lack of control


I think people _do_ still measure others with the same college-paper metric but apply it to a standardized imagined life {{or: timeline. | goals.}}
Play with a sense of joy and mischief. Play even if you are fearful. Play like you have nothing to lose because you don't.
