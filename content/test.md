was unable to finish my first real coding commission for [[App/Obsidian.md]]
<<<
This is in part due to extenuating circumstances (ie my grandmother passed away suddenly) but also due to not understanding my own limitations? it also just wasn't very fun to work with something. I've been off more than I could chew and don't really love arbitrary deadlines. oh and work got insane randomly at the same time. truly a bad couple weeks

Regular text

{{or:You|One}}
can you write a transformer plugin to parse the markdown file for variations of text like  
{{or:these here|and this|and this too}}.

Here is a simple footnote[^1]. and some more text can alway go here. Would be interesting to see how that shakes out

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with `<br>`.<br>This is a second line with an image too added an image here too <br><img src="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/img/rhino.png" alt="drawing" />
