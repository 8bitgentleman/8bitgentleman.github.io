Markdown this Markdown that, everybody seems to freaking love markdown.

Markdown is for people who, if given the options, would do everything in the terminal or a .txt file. Markdown is for people who aren't terribly concerned about visuals. Markdown is for people who like to memorize convoluted syntax instead of pressing a button.

Markdown is moving BACKWARDS from usability. It's only popular because it's a human readable file and therefore [[Open-Source]]-esque. Terrible user experience.

Markdown comes in a dozen different "flavors" each on with slightly different syntax and support for different features. Some flavors use the same symbols for totally different styling.

Markdown can format pure text simply and anything beyond that becomes much more challenging to visually parse.

Today's most popular tools for writing in markdown abstract away the convoluted syntax behind a nice UI while still relying on a 'source of truth' `.md` file. [^1] This is a [File overÂ app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app) philosophy and the basest form of interop.

Look at the most popular writing tool on the planet, **Word**. Love it or hate it there's a certain ease of use to it. Markdown is *scary* to most non-tech people

[^1]: Yes I acknowledge the irony in complaining about markdown on a statically generated site based on markdown files. Believe me I'm no happier about it than you. Sometimes you've got to play in the mud to eat from the trough.
