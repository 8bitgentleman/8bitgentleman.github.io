# Navigation through Design 


## Explorative Navigation


Navigating through a typical website is an endless amount of clicking and new tab opening with everything seen before gone or no longer visible.


With this site I'm trying to lower the barrier to putting ideas out into public and experimenting with way to create visual cues for the reader as to what is beyond the current page.

### Embedded meaning behind styling


Tags - #writing


- Concept pages that collect links to related pages


Pages - [[NOW]]


- Contain writing / content on theme 


Aliases


- [External aliases](http://google.com/) link to external websites

- [[index#^T0xmwnBMP|Internal aliases]] link to internal blocks


Footnotes

- Footnotes are for tangents and extranious information[^1] inline of a paragraph and happen sequentially for clarity[^2].


## House Style
Ultimately I'd like to enforce a house 'style', writing conventions that are similar across essays. Ink & Switch has some great essays about their essay ['Academish Voice'](https://inkandswitch.notion.site/Academish-Voice-0d8126b3be5545d2a21705ceedb5dd45) as well as their [essay style conventions](https://www.inkandswitch.com/article-style-guide.html). One of my favorite examples of this is David Millington's [house style](https://daveon.design/about-dave-on-design.html#house-style) essay.
