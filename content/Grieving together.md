 One of the most challenging parts of grief is the #loneliness. Grieving takes a *long* time. There's no way to know what that will look like for you until you find out.

 I lost my grandmother in the before times of 2020; before the world stopped. In many ways 2020 being like it was made dealing with my grief a little easier. 

 People are nice and gentle around you at first but that fades long before the grief is gone. That's not meant as a slight against others they're just not going through it. Time moves faster for them in a way that it can't for you.

 But in 2020 that was all different; we were *all* grieving. Grieving loved ones, grieving a loss of normalcy, grieving a loss of our own sense of possibility. We all went (are going through) that *together*. I didn't feel the need to hide my grief because there was plenty to go around. I didn't feel the need to shield my mercurial feelings because the last thing I wanted was to be *more* isolated.
