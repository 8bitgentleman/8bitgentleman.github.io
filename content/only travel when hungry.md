There's something about only traveling when I absolutely need to. Travel less out of a need to escape my present and more a hunger for difference.

I occasionally get restless. restless for new experiences, new people, new places. If I travel before the restlessness there's no curiosity and a place becomes flat instead of deep and rich

What should I do when I can only see the sameness and and am not energized by the differences?

maybe it's more about novelty . how can this be novel in novel ways?
- there's also something about it tied to loneliness and feeling in myself and not out into the world. frustration focused inward instead of curiosity focused outward
