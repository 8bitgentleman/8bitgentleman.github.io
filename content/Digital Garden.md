 A **digital Garden** is a living record of a person's thought process.  Much like a real garden it's intended to be *messy*, alive. Similar to the idea of "working with the garage door up".

- josh wcomeau [blog](https://joshwcomeau.com/gatsby/dark-mode/)


    - excelent link highlighting 

    - great popup previews


- [Amanda Pinsker | Reading](https://amandapinsker.com/reading#bad-blood)


    - sexy typography and layout combo

    - includes a photo of where she read the book, very cool idea!

    - pain points:


        - site is a single page with poor discoverability

        - only laid out for few highlights and a short blubs


    - makes use of footnote symbols (* † ‡ § ¶ ↗︎)

    - each highlight can be lined directly to

    - nice subtle animations on page load


- [Sawyer's Reading Highlights](https://highlights.sawyerh.com/)


    - great hover animation

    - Cons: everything is a page and there's a lot of lag

    - good use of marginalia

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMattVogel%2FnWlPXs92Hw.png?alt=media&token=634a87c9-9a9d-4bb4-8867-12c0b51b494f)


    - internal page links have a degree symbol at the end °


        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMattVogel%2FihRVCBsHdx.png?alt=media&token=0bd021d3-30f4-4aa3-8676-8397105c1c90)

        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMattVogel%2FihRVCBsHdx.png?alt=media&token=0bd021d3-30f4-4aa3-8676-8397105c1c90)


    - many pages have ['meditations'](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Meditation) for the reader


        - ['meditations'](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Meditation)


            - *"A "meditation" is a puzzle that the reader should attempt to solve, or a prompt that the reader should try to state their own reaction to, before continuing. Research shows that you're much more likely to remember useful info if you try to solve the problem yourself before reading the solution. Succeed or fail, the important thing is to have tried first."*



    - pain points:


        - No color, everything is shades of gray

        - everything is muted and tight, no intentionally mismatched typography or designed layout



- [[Person/Jordan Moore]]'s [public garden](http://jordanm.co.uk)


    - very cool side scrolling layout

    - pain points:


        - normal and boring on mobile

        - navigating to different pages is cumbersome 


    - really nice typographic layout and hierarchy


        - font - *SF Pro Display*

        - smaller font size than I expected


    - images are handled cleanly with css shapes  

    - doesn't feel like a bulleted list


- [reckoner165](https://www.acrosspolyethylene.com/)

- https://joelc.io/roam-shortcuts


    - Clicking on a shortcut opens it up to show some explanation text and a walkthrough gif

    - Nice use of subtle [[Visual Delight]]


- [[Person/Robin Sloan]]'s [[video game]] #newsletter 


    - https://www.robinsloan.com/overworld/week/3/

    - Very aesthetic

    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMattVogel%2FjPfktg4LRO.png?alt=media&token=ec60ea58-9260-4d7d-b736-50821b7359d0)

    - Text colors rotate and change


- [Mark Robertson's site](https://www.craft.do/s/wzKthqKQEz5NoM/b/9E3E9335-847D-4C99-8680-618AA94135CC/Dark/Light_Mode_-_@Murf_and)


    - uses craft.do

    - can switch between matuschak mode and regular blog mode

    - has breadcrumbs at the top to show your path through

    - page links show up as embeds with page preview and hover enlarge css. This is stylistically nice but actually takes quite a bit of screen realestate 


        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMattVogel%2FETovXcifq3.png?alt=media&token=af35666a-e103-4628-85d6-a6d23cb469eb)


    - page widths are relatively large by default, only 1.75 can fit on a screen at once (maybe too large?)

    - code snippets have slick popout with syntax highlighting and one click copy functions


- Public Bookshelves


    - https://books.rixx.de/ - [github](https://github.com/rixx/books.rixx.de)

- [@meekaale 's](https://goula.sh/)

- [[Person/Rodrigo Franco]]  [rodrigofranco.com](https://www.rodrigofranco.com)

- [jzhao.xyz](https://jzhao.xyz/) - this digital garden is so good it almost pisses me off

- [This beautiful site of a font creator](https://djr.com/fern/)

- https://typora.io/

- Typography and design focused https://daveon.design/ 


    - fascinating use of side notes that change color for both the note *and* the marker <br>https://daveon.design/creating-joy-in-the-user-experience.html

    - His paragraphs are justified which look *very* nice

    - liberal use of dropcaps


        - *the best design has an element of the human and whimsical. It allows the user to feel what they’re using was created by a person, and more, a person with a sense of both playfulness and beauty: it humanizes the digital, the aluminium and glass, the inhumane.*


    - The end of each page has a several breaklines and then the site icon which brings you back to the beginning

## #personal [[Digital Garden]] #ideas 


- sort pages by link density


    - the more interconnected the page is the higher it shows

    - maybe the top linked pages are showcased in the intro


- What about changing it to a Digital Roof Garden? 


    - Kind of illustrates that there is lots going on underneath 

    - Roof garden of The Company?


- Embed hypothes.is sidebar


    - [embed config options](https://h.readthedocs.io/projects/client/en/latest/publishers/config/)

    - [How to embed hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/help/embedding-hypothesis-in-websites-and-platforms/)

    - config


        - ```html<br><script type="application/json" class="js-hypothesis-config"><br>{<br>"showHighlights": true,<br>"branding": {<br>      appBackgroundColor: 'white',<br>      ctaBackgroundColor: 'rgba(3, 11, 16, 1)',<br>      ctaTextColor: '#eee',<br>      selectionFontFamily: 'helvetica, arial, sans serif'<br>    }<br>}<br></script><br><script async src="https://hypothes.is/embed.js"></script>```


    - [Guidelines](https://web.hypothes.is/help/how-to-establish-or-avoid-document-equivalence-in-the-hypothesis-system/)

    - should change scheme depending on dark mode


- Include custom JS or css as an attribute on the page


    - `Style::`


- Bookshelf


    - `Book/` Query

    - Practically the bookshelf is created by referencing namspaced books `Book/`. During basic page creation all book pages are collected and analyzed. Relevant attributes are scooped out and applied to a pre-made book template page (which ends up replacing). The book and cover are then added to a separate Bookshelf page with a pre-made template. [My old annotations site can be referenced.](https://8bitgentleman.github.io/annotation-department-site/)

    - Clicking on the book cover brings up a modal of the selected page

    - Maybe use [bookish.tech](https://bookish.tech) somehow?

    - Linked in the NavBar, the bookshelf is one of the primary pages for the garden

        - [Books recommended on the lexfridman podcast](https://lexfridmanlibrary.com/)

        - [Sawyer's Reading Highlights](https://highlights.sawyerh.com/)

        - [[Person/Maggie Appleton]]'s [website](https://maggieappleton.com/)


    - Random highlight button?

    - Sort by tag or favorite

    - {{[[embed]]: ((((5c0Bp8bR2))))}}

    - My [[Digital Garden]] should include a section for my highlights!


- Favorite words


    - Include a page to showcase my list of words


- My [[Digital Garden]] could have programming cheatsheet section similar to [devhints.io](https://devhints.io/)

- Favorite Recipes and thoughts about them


    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMattVogel%2FLNIwZWlHU0.png?alt=media&token=b9b8f1b4-7211-4fa1-8b46-b853d72f4dec)

    - [[Recipe at the Top]]


- Media Recommendations and what makes it special

- {{[[embed]]: ((((z_EjFrvup))))}}

- `Article/` pages should be handled carefully. Instead of displaying the `Content` attribute should I somehow embed the actual page? I don't want to be re-hosting someone else's work without permission.. 

- Could include a `/now` page about what's happening now


    - {{[[embed]]: ((((x7Ci2GwJV))))}}


- Issue № 1

- Pages should have a last edited timestamp


    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMattVogel%2FrhLNjJZM_b.png?alt=media&token=05da485b-d6ca-4cbd-8d8e-275016e757c0)


- A garden could include a personal timeline
