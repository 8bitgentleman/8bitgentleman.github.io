When you live your life [[on doing hard things|doing hard things because they are hard]] you become well acquainted with failure. People think the failure as an ending but it's not. Failure is [scaffolding](((53FynjYad)) for rockets yet to be launched.
Saying that and doing that are two vastly different things. Becoming comfortable with failure is a muscle like any other.

That doesn't mean failure doesn't affect you in some [[stoicism|stoic]] way but by practicing failure you learn how to bounce back a little faster and generally treat life as more of an #experiment

### things you can do to learn how to fail
1. Take an #improv class
2. [reach out to 10 people](((xZjFsu0JC))
3. start a conversation with a stranger
4. ask someone out on a date
5. ask five people to hang out over the weekend
