Quite often I'll go through a period (as short as a week and as long as a month) where I don't do much personally creative.[^1]

I wonder if this seeming dry spell or a perceived _lack_ of motivation/creativity is actually creativity being _roadblocked_ by something else. Perhaps my brain is still mulling over an old problem or I just have to many 'tabs' open so to speak.

I often find that problems solve themselves while on the backburner (see [[on knowing when to stop]] ) so maybe that 'backburner' takes up more mental energy than I realize

#### Things that can block creative pursuits
- stress
- poor sleep
- fear

[^1]: there's a tension here between professional and personal creativity. Most days I focus my creative output into crafting beautiful spaces for others
